A **highly decoupled**, **testable** TodoList app that uses React hooks.

This is a training repo to learn about new hooks feature of React and creating a testable environment.

- **Zero-dependency**
- **No** class components
- Uses `Context` to share a **global state**
- Uses `useReducer` to manage **state actions**
- `useState` to create local state
- Decoupled state logic (Actions)
